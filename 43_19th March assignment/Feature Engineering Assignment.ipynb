    "\n",
    "## Ans. :\n",
    "\n",
    "Min-max scaling is a data normalization technique that scales features in a dataset to a fixed range of values between 0 and 1. This is done by subtracting the minimum value of the feature from all values and then dividing the result by the range of the feature (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values).\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for min-max scaling is:\n",
    "\n",
    "__x_normalized = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))__\n",
    "\n",
    "where x is the original value, min(x) is the minimum value in the feature, and max(x) is the maximum value in the feature.\n",
    "\n",
    "Min-max scaling is used in data preprocessing to ensure that all features are on the same scale, which is particularly important in machine learning algorithms that are sensitive to the scale of the input data. It is commonly used in image processing, natural language processing, and other domains where feature scaling is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose we have a dataset containing the heights of individuals in centimeters. The minimum height is 150 cm, and the maximum height is 200 cm. We can apply min-max scaling to the dataset by subtracting 150 from each height and dividing the result by 50 (the range of heights):\n",

    "\n",
    "## Ans. :\n",
    "\n",
    "The Unit Vector technique in feature scaling, also known as \"normalization,\" involves scaling the features so that each feature has a unit norm (i.e., magnitude of 1). This is done by dividing each feature value by the Euclidean norm of the feature vector.\n",

    "__x_scaled = (x - min(x)) / (max(x) - min(x))__\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference between the Unit Vector technique and Min-Max scaling is the way the features are scaled. While the Unit Vector technique ensures that all features have a magnitude of 1, Min-Max scaling ensures that all features fall within a specified range.\n",

    "An example of the application of the Unit Vector technique is in text classification, where documents are represented as feature vectors using techniques such as Bag-of-Words or TF-IDF. In this case, the Unit Vector technique can be used to normalize the feature vectors so that the length of the document (i.e., the number of words) does not affect the similarity between documents."

    "\n",
    "## Ans. :\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA, or Principle Component Analysis, is a statistical technique that is commonly used for dimensionality reduction. The goal of PCA is to identify a lower-dimensional representation of the data that captures as much of the variance in the original data as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA works by identifying the linear combinations of the original features, called principle components, that capture the most variance in the data. These principle components are ordered in terms of their ability to explain the variance in the data, with the first principle component capturing the most variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA can be used in dimensionality reduction by selecting a subset of the principle components that capture the majority of the variance in the data. This allows for a lower-dimensional representation of the data that still captures most of the important information.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example of the application of PCA is in image processing. Images are typically represented as high-dimensional feature vectors, with each pixel being a separate feature. However, many of these features are redundant, as they may be correlated with other features or may not contain much useful information.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, PCA can be used to identify a lower-dimensional representation of the image that still captures most of the important information. For example, if the first 50 principle components capture 95% of the variance in the image data, we can use only those 50 components as our new feature representation, rather than the original high-dimensional feature vectors.\n",
