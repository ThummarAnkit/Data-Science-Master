In this case, the intercept would represent the starting salary for someone with no years of education, which may not make sense in this context. A better interpretation would be to consider the slope coefficient, which represents the expected change in salary for every additional year of education. If the slope coefficient is 5, for example, it means that the expected increase in salary is $5,000 for every additional year of education."

Additionally, if the relationship between the variables is truly linear, linear regression may be more appropriate and easier to interpret."
