    "__Ans. :__<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the 90% confidence interval for the true population mean, we can use the formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "__CI = X̄ ± Zα/2 * (σ/√n)__\n",
    "\n",
    "where __X̄__ is the sample mean, σ is the population standard deviation, __n__ is the sample size, __Zα/2__ is the critical value from the standard normal distribution at the 90% confidence level, and __CI__ is the confidence interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Find the critical value\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the confidence level is 90%, the level of significance is α = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10. From the standard normal distribution table, the critical value for a two-tailed test at a 10% level of significance is Zα/2 = 1.645.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Calculate the confidence interval\n",

    "__CI = 65 ± 1.645 * (8/√50)<br>\n",

    "So the 90% confidence interval for the true population mean is (62.67, 67.33).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Interpret the result\n",
    "\n",
    "We are 90% confident that the true population mean lies between 62.67 and 67.33. This means that if we were to repeat this process many times, creating many samples and calculating their confidence intervals, approximately 90% of those intervals would contain the true population mean."

The null hypothesis is that there is no significant difference in reaction time between participants who consumed caffeine and those who did not.
