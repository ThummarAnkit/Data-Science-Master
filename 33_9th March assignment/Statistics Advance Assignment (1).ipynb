    "\n",
    "The __Probability Mass Function (PMF)__ and __Probability Density Function (PDF)__ are two important concepts in probability theory that are used to describe the probability distribution of a random variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __Probability Mass Function (PMF)__ is used for discrete random variables, which take on a finite or countably infinite number of possible values. The PMF assigns a probability to each possible value of the random variable, such that the sum of all the probabilities is equal to 1. In other words, the PMF gives the probability that a discrete random variable takes a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider a fair six-sided die. The PMF of the die can be defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "P(X = 1) = 1/6<br>\n",
    "P(X = 2) = 1/6<br>\n",
    "P(X = 3) = 1/6<br>\n",
    "P(X = 4) = 1/6<br>\n",
    "P(X = 5) = 1/6<br>\n",
    "P(X = 6) = 1/6<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "where X is the random variable representing the outcome of a single roll of the die. Each value of the PMF corresponds to the probability of rolling a specific number on the die.\n",
    "\n",
    "The __Probability Density Function (PDF)__, on the other hand, is used for continuous random variables, which take on a continuous range of possible values. The PDF assigns a probability density to each possible value of the random variable, such that the total area under the PDF curve is equal to 1. In other words, the PDF gives the probability that a continuous random variable falls within a certain range of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider the normal distribution with mean μ = 0 and standard deviation σ = 1. The PDF of this distribution is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### f(x) = (1/√(2πσ^2)) * exp(-(x-μ)^2/(2σ^2))\n",
    "\n",
    "where x is a continuous random variable. The PDF assigns a probability density to each possible value of x, and the probability of x falling within a certain range is equal to the area under the PDF curve between those values. For example, the probability of x falling between -1 and 1 can be calculated by integrating the PDF over that range:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P(-1 ≤ X ≤ 1) = ∫(-1 to 1) f(x) dx\n",

It is also used to generate random numbers from a given distribution using inverse transform sampling, which is a common technique used in simulation and modeling."
